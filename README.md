# Git-lessons-
Lessons ( will be updated from time to time as I learn )

I would like to make a one stop Repo for all git and github enquires

# IT would be important to have excalidraw for you to sees the notes.

* Excalidraw extension can be found on VSCode 
* For the OGs(vim users) they also have a website where you can paste this file and get to move away from the dark screen (terminal).
